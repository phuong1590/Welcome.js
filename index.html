						First of all,let's talk about how going to school makes us less intelligence.
					</section>
					<section>
						Alright so,why does school make us less intelligence?Because there are many type of intelligence.
						And school only teaches us Academy Intelligence.
					</section>
					<section>
						I argee that schools are important,they really do.But for example,the way they teach C++ in my school.
						Are so lame,they only teach you the "How" part.Like how to get high grades,how to get pass classes so you won't have to study it again and losses your or your parents money.
					</section>
					<section>
						It's really impossible for me to sit there for nearly 4 or 5 hours to listen to their nonsense.Just how they call "variable" in Vietnamese and other stuff in Vietnamese makes me mad since I really can't understand what they meant.This makes me have no interest in learning how to code in C++,but I have found a 4 hours long on Youtube that actually did a better job than my teacher in 2 weeks.
					</section>
					<section>
						What I and what I believe everyone needs to know,is the "Why" part.
						Since they are people in my class pronouncing "cout" as "count".
						Maybe they are bad at English or they just didn't understand that "cout" stands for "console out".No one taught them that.
